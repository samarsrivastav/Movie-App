# React Vite Movie Details App

Welcome to the React Vite Movie Details App! This project is a simple application that allows you to search for and view movie details using the OMDB API. Whether you're learning React and Vite or want to explore how to create a movie details app, this project provides a great starting point.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get this project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing packages
-[vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-movie-details-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-vite-movie-details-app
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

### API Key Configuration

To fetch data from the OMDB API, you'll need an API key. You can obtain a free API key by signing up at the [OMDB website](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

After obtaining your API key, create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key as follows:

```env
REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Development

You can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and your React application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

This will generate optimized production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `components/` - React components used in the application.
  - `App.jsx` - The main entry point of the application.
